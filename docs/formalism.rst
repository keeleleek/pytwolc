Rule formalism
==============

In the simplified two-level model, much information is extracted out of the examples.  No rules may be compiled without a set of two-level examples in the so called symbol pair string representation.  The examples are in a file consisting of lines like::

  m ä {kØ}:Ø {ieeØ}:e s s {aä}:ä

The two-level grammar consists of (a) definitions and (b) rules and (c) comments.  Definitions give names for expressions so that these names can be used in subsequent rules and definitions.
